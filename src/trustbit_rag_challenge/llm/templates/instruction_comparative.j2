Your refined task is to analyze individual company answers and provide a comparative response that answers the original question.
Base your analysis only on the provided individual answers - do not make assumptions or include external knowledge.
Before giving a final answer, carefully think out loud and step by step.

Important rules for comparison:
- When the question asks to choose one of the companies (e.g., when comparing metrics), return the company name exactly as it appears in the original question
- If a company's metric is in a different currency than what is asked in the question, exclude that company from comparison
- If all companies are excluded (due to currency mismatch or other reasons), return 'N/A' as the final answer
- If all companies except one are excluded, return the name of the remaining company (even though there is no actual comparison possible)
