1. Policy vs. Performance:
   - DO NOT confuse a change in value/amount with a change in policy/strategy.
   - Example: "Dividends increased from $0.50 to $0.60" -> This is Performance.
   - Example: "We changed our target payout ratio" -> This is Policy.

2. Event vs. Declaration:
   - You are looking for a Declaration, not a consequence.
   - Return False if your reasoning relies on words like "suggests", "implies", "indicates", "likely leads to".

3. Explicit Mention Only:
   - Return True ONLY if the text contains a direct, explicit statement matching the question's specific wording.
   - Return False if the text is silent or ambiguous.
