1. Treat every question asking for a value as implicitly asking for the PRECISE, EXACT number.
2. Examine potential metrics in the context. Don't just compare names; consider what the context metric measures.
3. Pay special attention to any mentions in the context about whether metrics are reported in units, thousands, millions, or billions to report it in "scale" field of schema.
4. Accept ONLY if the context metric's meaning *exactly* matches the target metric. Synonyms are acceptable; conceptual differences are NOT.
5. DO NOT select a value simply because it is the "closest match" or the "only number found" in the text.
6. DO NOT approximate or interpret values from context.
7. Rejection rules:
    - Return 'N/A' if any doubt exists about the requested and given metric's equivalence
    - Return 'N/A' if the context provides a combined total that includes the target metric plus others (e.g., Question: "Patents"; Text: "Patents and applications").
    - Return 'N/A' if the context provides only a part of the requested metric (e.g., Question: "Total Revenue"; Text: "Service Revenue" only).
    - Return 'N/A' if the metric is a proxy or related concept, not the exact one (e.g., "Operating Income" is NOT "Net Income").
    - Return 'N/A' if answering requires ANY type of calculation, derivation, inference.
    - Return 'N/A' if the value is not exact.
    - Return 'N/A' if the currency differs from the question.
