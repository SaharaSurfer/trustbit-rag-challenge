Question: "What was the total assets of 'Waste Connections Inc.' in the fiscal year 2022?"
Answer:
{
  "step_by_step_analysis": "1. **Metric Definition:** The question asks for 'total assets' for 'Waste Connections Inc.' in fiscal year 2022. 'Total assets' represents the sum of all resources owned.\n2. **Context Examination:** The context includes 'Consolidated Balance Sheets' (page 78).\n3. **Metric Matching:** On page 78, under 'December 31, 2022', a line item labeled 'Total assets' exists. This directly matches.\n4. **Value Extraction:** The value is '$18,500,342'. The context indicates this is in thousands.\n5. **Formatting:** I will extract the raw number 18500342 and set the scale to 'thousands'.",

Example 2:
Question: "For Ritter Pharmaceuticals, Inc., what was the value of Research and development equipment, at cost?"
Answer:
{
  "step_by_step_analysis": "1. Question asks for 'Research and development equipment, at cost'.\n2. Context (page 35) shows 'Property and equipment, net' at $12,500. This is net, not cost.\n3. Context (page 37) shows 'Accumulated Depreciation'.\n4. Neither matches 'at cost' specific to R&D.\n5. Answer is 'N/A'.",
  "reasoning_summary": "Context lacks specific line item for R&D equipment at cost.",
  "relevant_pages": [35, 37],
  "final_answer": "N/A",
  "scale": "ones"
}

Example 3:
Question: "According to the annual report, what is the Operating margin (%) for 'Water Systems Plc'?"
Answer:
{
  "step_by_step_analysis": "1. The question asks for 'Operating margin (%)'.\n2. The context (Page 21) lists 'Revenue from Sales' (12,168) and 'Operating Loss' (3,062).\n3. However, the text does not explicitly state a value for 'Operating margin' or provide a percentage figure.\n4. Obtaining the answer would require dividing Operating Loss by Revenue ((3,062 / 12,168) * 100).\n5. The instructions strictly forbid calculation or derivation. Since the specific metric is not explicitly written in the text, the answer is 'N/A'.",
  "reasoning_summary": "Context provides the raw components (Revenue, Operating Loss) but does not explicitly report the 'Operating margin' percentage. Calculations are prohibited. Answer is 'N/A'.",
  "relevant_pages": [21],
  "final_answer": "N/A",
  "scale": "ones"
}
